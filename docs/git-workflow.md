# Project Vaca – Git Workflow

This is our step-by-step process for writing code and merging changes!

---

## Steps

1. **Make a new branch** for each feature or bugfix.  
   Example: `feature/add-login`, `bugfix/fix-calendar`

2. **Do your work** in that branch and commit your changes.

3. **Open a Pull Request** into the `dev` branch.

4. **Review and test** changes in `dev`.  
   Fix anything that doesn’t work.

5. **When `dev` is stable and ready,** open a Pull Request into `main`.

6. **Final review, then merge** to `main`—now it’s ready for production!
